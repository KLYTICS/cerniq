# CERNIQ — Agent briefing for new Claude sessions

> **Read this in the first 60 seconds of a new session in this repo.**
> It's the cold-pickup compression of CLAUDE.md (156 lines), the master
> handoff (740 lines), the work board (840 lines), and the session log
> (3,300+ lines). After this, you know enough to act safely.

## What CERNIQ is (one sentence)

CERNIQ is the neutral verification, policy enforcement, behavioral
attestation, and signed-audit layer between AI agents and the services
they act on. We hold **public keys only**, sign **only what we
observed**, and stay **vendor / model / protocol neutral**. The wedge:
[`docs/MASTER_ENGINEERING_HANDOFF.md`](./MASTER_ENGINEERING_HANDOFF.md) §6.

---

## Before you do anything (60-second checklist)

```sh
# 1. Who else is in here right now?
~/.claude/peers/bin/claude-peers status

# 2. Where is the repo? Anything dirty?
cd /Users/money/Desktop/CERNIQ && git status --short

# 3. What was the last round? (newest at top)
head -80 docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md
```

The peers system is **advisory mode** — claims don't lock paths. They
tell you who else is editing what so you don't overwrite their
in-flight work. Always claim your scope:

```sh
~/.claude/peers/bin/claude-peers claim cerniq "<scope-name>" \
  --note "<one-line summary>" --ttl 14400
```

Heartbeat every 20–30 minutes (`peers heartbeat`). Release when done.
Send a `peers msg <sid>` to coordinate cross-cutting changes.

## The six non-negotiable invariants

These are **inviolable**. If your work would break one, stop and write
an ADR in `docs/decisions/` first.

| #   | Invariant                                    | Where it's enforced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Private keys never enter CERNIQ.**         | SDK generates client-side; only `publicKey` on register.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2   | **Verify hot path is portable.**             | `apps/api/src/modules/verify/algorithm/verify.algorithm.ts` has zero NestJS / Prisma / Node-only imports. CF Workers must run the same code.                                                                                                           |
| 3   | **Audit log is append-only and signed.**     | `audit.service.append()` is the only write path. No UPDATE / DELETE on `AuditEvent`. Hash chain + Ed25519 sig per row.                                                                                                                                 |
| 4   | **No silent failures, no fabricated data.**  | Redis-down → fail-closed `ANOMALY_FLAGGED`. No synthetic trust scores. No empty arrays masquerading as "no results".                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Multi-tenant isolation by `principalId`.** | Every service method takes principalId first; every Prisma query has `where: { principalId }`; RLS belt-and-braces.                                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | **Denial precedence is fixed and ordered.**  | `AGENT_NOT_FOUND → AGENT_REVOKED → INVALID_SIGNATURE → POLICY_REVOKED → POLICY_EXPIRED → SCOPE_NOT_GRANTED → SPEND_LIMIT_EXCEEDED → TRUST_SCORE_TOO_LOW → ANOMALY_FLAGGED`. Locked by ADR-0004 + `tests/cross-package/denial-precedence-enum.spec.ts`. |

## Where to start (by intent)

### "I want to add a new feature"

1. Check `WORK_BOARD.md` for an open module that fits.
2. Claim it via peers + flip STATUS to `claimed by <sid>`.
3. Read the module's listed Goal + Acceptance + paths.
4. Stay inside the listed paths. Coordinate via peers msg if you need to cross.

### "I want to fix a bug"

1. Reproduce locally (`docs/RUNBOOK.md`).
2. If it's an invariant violation → `docs/INCIDENT_RUNBOOK.md` first.
3. Write the regression test in `tests/cross-package/` if it spans surfaces, otherwise in the module's `*.spec.ts`.
4. Fix; submit; run `pnpm vitest run` from root for the parity sweep.

### "I want to extend a foundational integration"

1. Find the closest example in `examples/`.
2. Read `docs/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md` § for that vertical.
3. Don't reinvent — the dual-verify pattern (acp-bridge), per-rail trust (banking-rails), MCP wrap (ai-platform-tool-call) are the canonical shapes.

### "I'm operating in production"

1. `docs/INCIDENT_RUNBOOK.md` for SEV-1/SEV-2.
2. `infra/observability/runbooks/` for specific alert symptoms.
3. `docs/CAPACITY_PLAN.md` § for SLA targets.

### "I want to ship a public package"

1. `packages/audit-verifier/` and `packages/verifier-rp/` are the two MIT-licensed external-facing packages. The pattern: closed dep set (`@noble/*` only), edge-runtime ready, paired specs, "what's intentionally absent" README section.
2. Add a parity test in `tests/cross-package/` that locks the public surface against the API.

## Quality bar (mirror to your work)

```
[ ] No `any` without // type-rationale: prefix
[ ] noUncheckedIndexedAccess respected
[ ] Every public service method has a unit test OR // untestable: <reason>
[ ] Errors are CerniqError subclasses (apps/api/src/common/errors/)
[ ] Constants live in packages/types/src/constants.ts
[ ] No Math.random() in production paths (tests/seeds OK)
[ ] Crypto code has paired .spec.ts — NO exceptions
[ ] No fabricated data, no synthetic trust scores
[ ] Multi-tenant: principalId is the FIRST argument of every service method
[ ] Verify hot path: zero NestJS/Prisma/ioredis in verify.algorithm.ts
[ ] Audit append: only via audit.service.append()
[ ] New env vars in apps/api/src/config/config.schema.ts
[ ] New modules in apps/api/src/app.module.ts imports array
[ ] Schema changes have migration + backfill
[ ] spec-sync.yml CI passes (parity scripts in packages/types/scripts and apps/api/scripts)
```

## What's safe to add right now (additive paths)

These directories are **non-conflicting** if you stay strictly inside them:

- `examples/<new-vertical>/` — new integration examples
- `tests/cross-package/<new-parity>.spec.ts` — new regression guards
- `docs/<NEW_DOC>.md` — new documentation
- `tools/<new-utility>/` — new operator / partner tooling
- `packages/<new-public-package>/` — new MIT-licensed package
- `infra/observability/runbooks/<new-runbook>.md` — new alert runbooks

These are **shared / claim-required** before editing:

- `apps/api/src/**` — coordinate with peers; `app.module.ts` is the busiest hotspot
- `apps/dashboard/**` — dashboard peers usually own this
- `apps/api/prisma/**` — schema migrations need explicit ADR
- `OPERATOR_DECISIONS.md`, `WORK_BOARD.md` — peer-dirty
- `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` — append-only at top, never rewrite

---

## How to make CI green before you commit

```sh
# Workspace-wide test sweep including cross-package parity:
pnpm vitest run

# Spec-sync:
pnpm -F @cerniq/types spec-sync       # OpenAPI ↔ Zod
pnpm -F @cerniq/api spec-sync         # OpenAPI ↔ Prisma

# API typecheck:
pnpm -F @cerniq/api typecheck

# Dashboard typecheck:
pnpm -F @cerniq/dashboard typecheck
```

Anything red here will be red in CI. Don't push until all green
locally — peers downstream will notice.

---

## When in doubt

1. Read CLAUDE.md.
2. Search SESSION_HANDOFF for the most recent session that touched
   your area.
3. `peers msg <sid>` the most recent author if their work is unclear.
4. Cite the file:line you're working from when describing what you'll
   do — it forces concrete thinking and gives the next Claude session
   anchors to follow.

> **The single best thing you can do for the next session: leave a
> handoff entry that's specific enough to act on cold.**
